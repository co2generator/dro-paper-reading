### Background

Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has attracted many research interests since 2010. This repository is mainly used for paper reading notes which will be written in Tex. In every notes, the problem setting, motivation, solution approach and so on will be reported. The paper list has been shown in the following section.
